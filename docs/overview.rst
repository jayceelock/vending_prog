Overview
========

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.6 or newer but not Python 3.x
* pyUSB and libusb (for native USB readers)
* pySerial (for serial readers on COM or USB)

Installation
------------

A tarball or install package is not yet available. Installation means
to branch the repository at https://code.launchpad.net/nfcpy into a
local directory and import the nfc module or execute commands from
that directory (or add the directory to PYTHONPATH).

Installation on (Ubuntu) Linux is as easy as: ::

  $ sudo apt-get install bzr # to download from repository
  $ sudo apt-get install python-usb # for USB readers
  $ sudo apt-get install python-serial # for TTY readers
  $ cd <some-dir>
  $ bzr branch lp:nfcpy # creates a copy in ./trunk/
  $ examples/tagtool.py show # then touch a tag

Supported Hardware
------------------

These readers are supported on Linux, Windows and Mac:

* Sony RC-S330/360/370/380
* SCM SCL3710/11/12
* ACS ACR122U

These readers are supported on Linux (and probably Mac):

* Arygon ACS122U
* Arygon APPB US
* Stollmann NFC Reader

Notes:

* The Sony RC-S380 is the only reader for which *nfcpy* currently
  supports tag emulation, more specifically Type 3 Tag emulation.

* The NXP PN53x can not properly handle Type 1 Tags with dynamic
  memory layout (Topaz 512) due to a firmware bug that not allow
  READ-8 and WRITE-8 commands to be executed.

* The NXP PN531 chip does not support any Type 1 Tag command and is
  also not able to exchange Type 4 Tag commands if the ReadBinary and
  UpdateBinary commands exceed the length of a standard host
  controller frame (which may happen if the card sets ISO-DEP MIU
  as 256).

* The ACR122U is disabled as P2P Listener because the listen time
  cannot be set shorter than 5 seconds.
